General overview of the terms for promo codes at hostingby.design

## Applicable

- Codes are in general applicable to everyone whether they are existing clients or new clients
- Unless otherwise stated all promo codes are recurring for the duration of the service lifetime

## Exceptions

- Promo codes cannot be used for existing services, they are exclusively for new products being sold.
- Promo codes are not transferable to another service, this includes upgrades to the existing package.
- We do not always cover all of our products in a promotion, that'll be clear in the promotion offering but the promo code will also display it on checkout.
- Unless otherwise stated, promo codes do not work on annual payments as those already include a discount.
- Promo codes cannot be "saved" for later, once expired they are expired for good.

## What do/don't we assist with on orders done with a promo code

- If you are migrating from another vendor we assist with migrations as per our usual process.
- If you are an existing client we unfortunately do not offer our migration services if you are moving to a product bought on a promotion code.
- If you are an existing client and decide to buy a product on promotion then we do not provide a pro-rated refund for your remaining period, this can be if you have an annual plan with 7 months left, if you opt to replace that package with a service bought on promotion the remaining period cannot be refunded.

Should the above give any questions then you are more than welcome to reach out via [ticket](https://my.hostingby.design/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=2) or email and we'll do our best to explain.
