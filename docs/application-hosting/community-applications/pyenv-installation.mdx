pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well.
For more information on pyenv, see [github.com/pyenv/pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

## Installation
Installation requires you to SSH into your server. If you need help with this, please refer to the [how do I connect](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md) article.

1. Make a `tmp` folder in your home directory.
```
mkdir -p "$HOME/tmp" && export TMPDIR="$HOME/tmp"
```
2. Install pyenv
```
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```
3. Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file.
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```
4. Reload your shell.
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
5. Install the python version you wish to have usable with pyenv.
```
pyenv install 3.12.0
```
6. Head to the directory where you wish to set the python version from the previous step to be usable in.
```
cd /path/to/directory
```
7. Set the directory pyenv version.
```
pyenv local 3.12.0
```
8. Create an environment in that directory.
```
pyenv virtualenv {environment-name}
```
9. Activate the environment.
```
pyenv activate {environment-name}
```
