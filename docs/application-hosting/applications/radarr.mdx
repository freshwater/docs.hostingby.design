Radarr is an independent fork of Sonarr reworked for automatically downloading movies via Usenet and BitTorrent.

## Initial Setup

First you must connect to your slot via ssh. If you need help connecting to the server, please read the help article [here](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md).

Installing Radarr is easy. Simply issue the following command:

```plaintext main
box install radarr
```

This command will configure radarr for your user.

## How to Access

:::caution On initial launch it is critical that you use the same login credentials AND set authentication to "Forms based" logins when asked to setup credentials!
:::

After Radarr has been installed, it will be available for access at `https://<hostname.io>/radarr`.

## Service Management

Like all box configured applications, you can manage Radarr via SSH with box with start, stop, restart, enable and disable commands.

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="radarr" />

## Configuration

Out of the box, Radarr comes with very little configuration. Following are some basic tasks to help get your client up and running:

### Add a new show (and your first root directory)

1. At the top, click series.
2. Click the button `+ Add Movie`
3. Type the name of the show you want to add
4. Under `Path`, choose `Add a new path`. Enter the path for the folder you wish to add your Sonarr shows to and click the green checkmark to add the directory.

- e.g. `/home/<username>/media/Movies`

5. Change the other settings to your own needs
6. Click the green + to add the show.

### Connect download clients

import Clients from "../snippets/clients.mdx";

<Clients />

### Add an indexer with Jackett

Radarr only supports a few trackers out of the box, but the indexers can be expanded by using the application [Jackett](jackett.mdx). To add an indexer with Jackett, use the following steps.

:::note
By default, when receivng the torznab feed from Jackett, it will need to be modified to be connected with the application. The default link looks like:

```plaintext
https://app02.hostingby.design/jackett/api/v2.0/indexers/yourtracker/results/torznab/
```

We need to edit this link to **remove https** and **add the port number**. Thus, if your port number was `12345`, your editted URL would look like this:

```plaintext
http://app02.hostingby.design:12345/jackett/api/v2.0/indexers/yourtracker/results/torznab/
```

:::

1. Go to `Settings > Indexers` and click `+` to add a new indexer.
2. Under `Torrent` choose `Torznab`
3. Use the settings:

```plaintext main
Name: <tracker name>
URL: <click copy torznab feed in jackett and modify as per above>
API: <copy and paste from jackett UI>
```

4. Click `Test`. If all is good, click `Save`.

### Radarr not working after update

In some cases when Radarr is updated through the WebUI, you may encounter an issue where Radarr is not starting correctly. Thankfully there is an easy fix:

1. Make sure you have a red dot next to Radarr in the Swizzin WebUI.
2. Login via SSH and navigate `cd ~/.config/Radarr/` and copy the radarr.db with `cp radarr.db ~/`
3. Go back into your home dir with `cd ~/` and then run `box remove radarr` and then `box install radarr`
4. After Radarr is installed, go into the Swizzin WebUI and turn off Radarr with the Enabled switch, wait around 10-20 seconds for the Radarr instance to be completely turned off, noted by the Red Dot next to Radarr.
5. Go back into the Radarr config folder with `cd ~/.config/Radarr` and remove the radarr.db, radarr.db-shm, radarr.db-wal and radarr.pid files with `rm radarr.db, radarr.db-shm, radarr.db-wal and radarr.pid`. Now navigate back to your home dir with `cd ~/` and copy over the backup of your .db file with `cp radarr.db ~/.config/Radarr/`
6. Now you are free to turn on Radarr back from the switch in the Swizzin Panel.

### Other tasks

You may wish to further alter your setup by setting quality profiles or setting up post-processing so that media is automatically transferred to your Radarr library when your torrents are completed.
