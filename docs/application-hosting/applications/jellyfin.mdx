:::tip Upgrading
Upgrading your Jellyfin instance is a simple process, login to the webui/dashboard we provide for your service, find the "Service info" section in the page you are presented with, from there simply click "Restart" next to jellyfin, that will restart the app and also check for updates, please note that we are usually 2-3 days behind on updates!
:::

```bash
box install jellyfin
```

:::caution Finish install in browser
Please make sure to finish the setup of the application through the web browser, and create your admin user.

## Access

You can access jellyfin through `https://appxx.lw.hostingby.design/<yourusername>/jellyfin`.

Beware, some users have reported that some applications/versions of the jellyfin apps require a trailing slash to work, so if you are using the above url and are having connection issue then please append a / at the end of the url.

## Library management

By default, you home directory will be mounted in Jellyfin as `/data/`. There you will find all of the files from your home directory. If you setup an application like l3uddz autoscan with the *arrs, you may need to use a `rewrite rule` to replace `/home/username` with `/data`.

## User management

Jellyfin manages its users in a separate database. Please use the Web-UI to manage users and media.

## Service management

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="jellyfin" />

## Troubleshooting

If you were early-access to the apprange and have been experiencing issues with Jellyfin, please change your transcode hardware acceleration to "none".

Jellyfin has a general [Troubleshooting guide](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/troubleshooting.html) which we highly suggest you follow first in case you have any issues.

If you recently reinstalled Jellyfin, you may need to clear your cookies and cache for your appbox url to properly access the web interface.

If all else fails, consider putting in a [ticket](https://my.hostingby.design/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=2).
