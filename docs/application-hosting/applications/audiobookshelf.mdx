Audiobookshelf is a media server designed for Audio books and to access them anywhere. 

## Initial Setup
First you must connect to your slot via ssh. If you need help connecting to the server, please read the help article [here](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md).

After you have successfully SSH'd into your service, all you need to do is type this command to install the application:
