Audiobookshelf is a media server designed for Audio books and to access them anywhere. 

## Initial Setup
First you must connect to your slot via ssh. If you need help connecting to the server, please read the help article [here](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md).

After you have successfully SSH'd into your service, all you need to do is type this command to install the application:
```plaintext main
box install audiobookshelf
```
It will take a minute or two to install, after which you will see a message stating that the app has been installed and where you can access the application, and the link to the app will appear in your Swizzin panel.

:::tip Upgrading
Due to a few custom tweaks we need to do to get the app working properly, automatic updates for Audiobookshelf are disabled. We will manually push updates as often as possible, but due to us needing to run tests before updates are pushed, we will be running a bit behind on the updates just to make sure everything works as intended.

## How to Access
You can access Audiobookshelf from your Swizzin panel by clicking the link labeled Audiobookshelf.  
:::tip Tip
If you forgot your personalized port, you can check it with at `cat ~/.install/.audiobookshelf.lock`

## Configuration

Upon your first login you will be asked to select a Username and Password to use to access Audiobookshelf. **It is best to use the same username and password you use to access Swizzin/your slot**. There is no need to change the Directory Paths!
After setting the username/password, you can login to your instance and add a Library by clicking the Add Library button.
**Your slots Home Folder can be accessed under data/**

## Service Management

Like all box configured applications, you can manage Audiobookshelf via SSH with box with start, stop, restart, enable and disable commands.

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="audiobookshelf" />

## Connect to other clients

If you need to link your Audiobookshelf instance to another application, you can use the following details:

```plaintext main
Host: 127.0.0.1
Port: <your audiobookshelf port>
```
