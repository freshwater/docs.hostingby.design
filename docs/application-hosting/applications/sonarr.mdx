Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

## Initial Setup

First you must connect to your slot via ssh. If you need help connecting to the server, please read the help article [here](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md).

Installing Sonarr is easy. Simply issue the following command:

```plaintext main
box install sonarr
```

This command will configure sonarr for your user.

## How to Access

:::caution On initial launch it is critical that you use the same login credentials AND set authentication to "Forms based" logins when asked to setup credentials!
:::

Once setup, sonarr will be available at the link `https://<hostname.io>/sonarr`

## Service Management

Like all box configured applications, you can manage Sonarr via SSH with box with start, stop, restart, enable and disable commands.

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="sonarr" />

## Configuration

Out of the box, Sonarr comes with very little configuration. Following are some basic tasks to help get your client up and running:

### Add a new show (and your first root directory)

1. At the top, click series.
2. Click the button `+ Add Series`
3. Type the name of the show you want to add
4. Under `Path`, choose `Add a new path`. Enter the path for the folder you wish to add your Sonarr shows to and click the green checkmark to add the directory.

- e.g. `"/home/<username>/media/TV Shows"`

5. Change the other settings to your own needs
6. Click the green + to add the show.

### Connect download clients

import Clients from "../snippets/clients.mdx";

<Clients />

Since Sonarr v3, you will now need to disable certificate validation for localhost domains as well if you are connecting to port 443. You can find this setting in **Settings > General**.

### Add an indexer with Jackett

Sonarr only supports a few trackers out of the box, but the indexers can be expanded by using the application [Jackett](jackett.mdx). To add an indexer with Jackett, use the following steps.

:::note
By default, when receivng the torznab feed from Jackett, it will need to be modified to be connected with the application. The default link looks like:

```plaintext
https://app02.hostingby.design/jackett/api/v2.0/indexers/yourtracker/results/torznab/
```

We need to edit this link to **remove https** and **add the port number**. Thus, if your port number was `12345`, your editted URL would look like this:

```plaintext
http://app02.hostingby.design:12345/jackett/api/v2.0/indexers/yourtracker/results/torznab/
```

:::

1. Go to `Settings > Indexers` and click `+` to add a new indexer.
2. Under `Torrent` choose `Torznab`
3. Use the settings:

```plaintext main
Name: <tracker name>
URL: <click copy torznab feed in jackett and modify as per above>
API: <copy and paste from jackett UI>
```

4. Click `Test`. If all is good, click `Save`.

### Sonarr not working after update

In some cases when Sonarr is updated through the WebUI, you may encounter an issue where Sonarr is not starting correctly. Thankfully there is an easy fix:

1. Make sure you have a red dot next to Sonarr in the Swizzin WebUI.
2. Login via SSH and navigate `cd ~/.config/Sonarr/` and copy the sonarr.db with `cp sonarr.db ~/`
3. Go back into your home dir with `cd ~/` and then run `box remove sonarr` and then `box install sonarr`
4. After Sonarr is installed, go into the Swizzin WebUI and turn off Sonarr with the Enabled switch, wait around 10-20 seconds for the Sonarr instance to be completely turned off, noted by the Red Dot next to Sonarr.
5. Go back into the Sonarr config folder with `cd ~/.config/Sonarr` and remove the sonarr.db, sonarr.db-shm, sonarr.db-wal and sonarr.pid files with `rm sonarr.db, sonarr.db-shm, sonarr.db-wal and sonarr.pid`. Now navigate back to your home dir with `cd ~/` and copy over the backup of your .db file with `cp sonarr.db ~/.config/Sonarr/`
6. Now you are free to turn on Sonarr back from the switch in the Swizzin Panel.

### Other tasks

You may wish to further alter your setup by setting quality profiles or setting up post-processing so that media is automatically transferred to your Sonarr library when your torrents are completed.
