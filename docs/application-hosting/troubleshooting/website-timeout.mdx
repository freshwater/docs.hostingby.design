You might have been redirected to this page by our webserver - The reason for this is that your IP has been banned from accessing the server due too many incorrect login attempts.

This can happen if you have logged into the dashboard and then changed the password via ssh while having the dashboard open, it can also happen if you change logins for the individual applications that are behind our reverse proxy.

We take your security very seriously and implement a strict firewall infront of all of our applications/websites to ensure that your data remains safe.

The bans in questions are for 15 minutes, should you however run into issues still after that period has expired then please reach out via our ticket system and include your internet IP so we can check the status for you.
